 ** ATTENTION:                                                                      **
 *************************************************************************************
 ** Please do NOT edit this file, since a software update will override             **
 ** your changes.                                                                   **
 ** To do changes to the design, you have following possibilities:                  **
 ** - If you just want to change colors, then the color plugin in the admin area    **
 **   could an option for you.                                                      **
 ** - Create userdata/styles/setup_add.css (it will be placed after this file),     **
 **   and use the "!important" statements to override style definitions.            **
 ** - You can completely REPLACE setup_base.css by                                  **
 **   creating userdata/styles/setup_base.css . This is very dangerous, because     **
 **   you need to regularly check if the official setup_base.css gets changed or    **
 **   extended, and you need to apply the changes according to the master file.     **
