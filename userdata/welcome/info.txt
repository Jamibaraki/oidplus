About the folder "userdata/welcome"
-----------------------------------

The folder "welcome" contains the file "welcome.html",
which is the front page shown by the plugin "publicPages/000_objects".
You may edit this file to overwrite the default welcome page.
Please note:
- Since userdata/ is a protected directory,
  you cannot place resources (images, css etc.) there.
- Although the file extension is ".html", it may only contain plain
  HTML data (without head or body).

Internationalization:
To create a file with multiple languages, create them like this:
	welcome.html      <-- this is the file in the default language ("enus" = English USA)
	welcome$dede.html <-- this is the file for German ("dede")
