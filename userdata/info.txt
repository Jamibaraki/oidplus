The folder "userdata" contains various files that are unique
to your OIDplus installation. With a few exceptions (like this file),
the folder contents are safe from being accidentally changed or
deleted by SVN updates.

Generally speaking, everything inside "userdata" belongs to you,
and everything else belongs to OIDplus (and should not be changed).

Since this folder can also contain sensitive information
like log files or a SQLite database, the access to this
directory must be restricted. Therefore, please make sure
that your webserver (e.g. Apache) does not allow access
to this directory.
If the access is not denied, please check .htaccess (for Apache),
nginx.conf (for Nginx) or web.config (for Microsoft IIS).

Various plugins can put their data in this directory.
Here is a list of typical sub-folders:


Folder "attachments"
--------------------

Used by the plugin "publicPages/095_attachments".

Contents:
- userdata/attachments/filetypes.conf (optional) to define/overwrite fileformat descriptions placed in 3p/vts_fileformats/filetypes.conf
- Folders with attachments users have uploaded.

	Example for folder names:
		oid_2_999: for a normal OID
		oid_1_3_6_1_4_1_37476_30_9_<sysid>_<smallhash>: for a non-OID object
	If your system does not have a public key / system ID (e.g. because of missing OpenSSL, the names are
		oid_2_999: for a normal OID
		oid_2_25_<...>: for a GUID
		<md5hash>: for other non-OID objects

In order for the file attachment upload to work,
you need to adjust the folder permissions.
For example, on Linux "chown" to the user "www-data" or "chmod" to "0777".


Folder "baseconfig"
-------------------

The folder "baseconfig" contains the file "config.inc.php" which defines
important static settings like the database connection credentials or
security keys (ReCaptcha) etc.
Setup (/setup/) will show assist you in creating this config.inc.php file.


Folder "database"
-----------------

This folder can be used to store a SQLite database.
The default database name is" oidplus.db"


Folder "favicon"
----------------

If the file favicon.ico is existing, it will be chosen instead of img/favicon.ico


Folder "logs"
-------------

Contains the file oidplus.log created by plugin "logger/300_userdata_logfile".
Having log messages stored in the log files makes
processing of data easier. For example you can use "fail2ban" to
analyze the log file and automatically ban IP addresses of networks
that try to brute force an user account password.

Note:
- Make sure that oidplus.log can be written by your webserver (e.g. Apache).
- You can shrink the size of oidplus.log by using logrotate (only Linux)


Folder "resources"
------------------

This folder is used by the plugin "publicPages/500_resources"
(Section "Documents and resources")

Its contents will be merged with "res/" from the root directory.
"res/" contains the default resources which are part of the OIDplus
main installation (you shall not change or add anything to that folder),
while "userdata/resources" contains resources that you add yourself
(e.g. your impress, privacy statement, additional resources,
hyperlinks to your websites and products, etc.)

Valid contents:
- Sub folders
- *.url files (will be converted to a hyperlink in the menu on the left)
- *.html files (the HTML headline will define the title of the menu entry)
- You can define custom icons for any resource by placing the files ..._big.png and ..._tree.png


Folder "welcome"
----------------

The folder "welcome" contains the file "welcome.html",
which is the front page shown by the plugin "publicPages/000_objects".
You may edit this file to overwrite the default welcome page.
Please note:
- Since userdata/ is a protected directory,
  you cannot place resources (images, css etc.) there.
- Although the file extension is ".html", it may only contain plain
  HTML data (without head or body).
