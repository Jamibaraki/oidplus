
About the folder "userdata/attachments"
---------------------------------------

This folder is used by the plugin "publicPages/095_attachments".

Contents:
- userdata/attachments/filetypes.conf (optional) to define/overwrite fileformat descriptions placed in
  vendor/danielmarschall/fileformats/filetypes.conf
- Folders with attachments users have uploaded.

	Example for folder names:
		oid_2_999: for a normal OID
		oid_1_3_6_1_4_1_37476_30_9_<sysid>_<smallhash>: for a non-OID object
	If your system does not have a public key / system ID (e.g. because of missing OpenSSL), the names are
		oid_2_999: for a normal OID
		oid_2_25_<...>: for a GUID
		<md5hash>: for other non-OID objects

In order for the file attachment upload to work,
you need to adjust the folder permissions.
For example, on Linux "chown" to the user "www-data" or "chmod" to "0777".
