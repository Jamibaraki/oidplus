
About the folder "userdata/logs"
--------------------------------

This folder ontains the file oidplus.log created by plugin "logger/300_userdata_logfile".
Having log messages stored in the log files makes
processing of data easier. For example you can use "fail2ban" to
analyze the log file and automatically ban IP addresses of networks
that try to brute force an user account password.

Note:
- Make sure that oidplus.log can be written by your webserver (e.g. Apache).
- You can shrink the size of oidplus.log by using logrotate (only Linux)
