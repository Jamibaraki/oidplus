About the folder "userdata/styles"
----------------------------------

In this folder, you can place an alternative version of oidplus_base.css and setup_base.css.

Please note that the web browser will not access these CSS files.
The CSS data is processed in oidplus.min.css.php and setup/setup.min.css.php instead.

!! ATTENTION !!

(1) You need to make sure that your changes are in-sync with the current versions
    of oidplus_base.css and setup_base.css!

(2) Note that the userdata/ directory cannot be accessed using the browser,
    so if you need to use graphics, please put them in the folder "userdata_pub".
