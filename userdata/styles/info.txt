
About the folder "userdata/styles"
----------------------------------

In this folder, you can place an alternative version of oidplus_base.css and setup_base.css.

This folder can contain following files:

- oidplus_base.css : This file REPLACES the oidplus_base.css file of the currently active design.
                     Please see a WARNING below.
                     *DEPRECATED*: Please use a design plugin (located in plugins/design/)
                     in order to define individual designs for your system.
                     Design plugins also allow you to include graphics in the plugin
                     directory itself (so you don't need "userdata_pub").

- oidplus_add.css  : This file is added after oidplus_base.css
                     If you just want to override some styles, then you could write your
                     changes in oidplus_add.css and give them priority using the
                     "!important" statement.
                     Example: If you want to have your own logo, then you might want to
                     create an oidplus_add.css file which overrides "#system_title_logo"
                     using the "!important" statement. The logo is put into
                     userdata_pub.
                     You shall not edit plugins/design/*/logo.png, because things might
                     change during software updates.

- setup_base.css   : This file REPLACES the setup/setup_base.css file.
                     Please see a WARNING below.

- setup_add.css    : Like oidplus_add.css , this file is placed after setup_base.css
                     and allows you to do minor tweaks to the design.


!! ATTENTION !!

(1) You need to make sure that your changes are in-sync with the current versions
    of oidplus_base.css and setup_base.css!

(2) Note that the userdata/ directory cannot be accessed using the browser,
    so if you need to reference graphics, please put them in the folder "userdata_pub".
    (The CSS data is processed in oidplus.min.css.php and setup/setup.min.css.php instead.)
