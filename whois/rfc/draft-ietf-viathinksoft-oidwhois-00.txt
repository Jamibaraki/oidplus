INTERNET DRAFT               OID-over-WHOIS                 <Issue Date>


1  Introduction

   An Object Identifier (OID) is an extensively used identification
   mechanism jointly developed by ITU-T and ISO/IEC for naming any type
   of object with a globally unambiguous name. OIDs provide a persistent
   identification of objects based on a hierarchical structure of
   Registration Authorities (RA), where each parent has an Object
   Identifier and allocates Object Identifiers to child nodes. More
   information about OIDs can be found in Recommendation ITU-T X.660
   (2011) | ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012 [X660].

   There are a few methods of retrieving information about an Object
   Identifier, like:

   (A) Searching through web repositories like www.oid-info.com or
   www.alvestrand.no/objectid/ . This has the disadvantage that the
   information is usually not machine readable.

   (B) Retrieving information using the Object Identifier Resolution
   System (ORS) defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.672 | ISO/IEC 29168-1
   [X672]. This has the disadvantage that the Registration Authority
   needs to include specific DNS Resource Records to their domain, and
   additionally, all superior RAs must implement ORS.

   This document describes an additional method of retrieving
   information about OIDs, which is both human-readable and machine-
   readable.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, "RA" is an abbreviation for "Registration
   Authority" and "OID" is an abbreviation for "Object Identifier".

INTERNET DRAFT               OID-over-WHOIS                 <Issue Date>


2  Request

   OID-over-WHOIS uses the WHOIS protocol specified in RFC 3912
   [RFC3912].

   During the request, the client sends a query beginning with "oid:",
   followed by an OID in dot notation, as defined in RFC 2252 [RFC2252],
   but with following differences:

   (a) Numbers must not have leading zeroes.

   (b) A leading dot in front of the OID is permitted.

   (c) To query the root of the OID tree, the OID may be empty or only
   consist of a single dot.

   Examples of valid queries:

       oid:
       oid:.
       oid:2.999
       oid:.2.999

   All OIDs must be interpreted as absolute OIDs. Relative OIDs (e.g.
   relative to the root of the Registration Authority operating the
   WHOIS service) are not allowed.

2.1  Authentication tokens

   At the end of the query, the client may additionally append case
   sensitive, non-empty alphanumeric authentication tokens to control
   the display of confidential information.

   Each authentication token is prepended by a dollar sign ("$")

   Examples of valid queries:

       oid:2.999$firstToken
       oid:2.999$firstToken$secondToken

   Please note that authentication tokens are only a weak protection.
   For more information, see "security considerations".

2.2  BNF notation

   For the purposes of defining the query string, the following BNF
   definitions will be used. They are based on the BNF styles of RFC 822
   [RFC822].

   digit   = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"

   nonzero-digit = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"

   char  = "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" /
           "k" / "l" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p" / "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" /
           "u" / "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z" / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" /
           "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "I" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" /
           "O" / "P" / "Q" / "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" /
           "Y" / "Z" / digit

   positive-number = "0" / nonzero-digit *( digit )

   oid             = positive-number *( "." positive-number )

   optional-oid    = 0*1( "." ) 0*1( oid )

   authtoken       = char *( char )

   query           = "oid:" optional-oid *( "$" authtoken )


3.  Response

3.1  Format and encoding

   The response should be UTF-8 encoded (as defined in RFC 3629
   [RFC3629]), without Byte-Order-Mark (BOM).

   It is recommended that each line be limited to 80 characters.

   The response contains multiple lines with fields and values, which
   are separated by a double colon (":"). Whitespace characters after
   the double colon are allowed.

   Field names are case insensitive.

   If a value needs to be split into multiple lines, e.g. if the line
   would exceed the length limit, the key including double colon needs
   to be repeated at the beginning of the new line.

   If attributes have multiple values (e.g. multiple Unicode labels,

   alternative email-addresses etc.), a new line with the same field
   name may be added.

   Comment lines start with a percent sign ("%") at the beginning of a
   line, without whitespaces in front of it. Comment lines shall not be
   evaluated by machines.


3.2  Structure

   A response can have different sections, which are defined in the
   following clauses. It is recommended that sections are divided by at
   least one empty line and/or comment line.

   This RFC defines following sections (which should stay in this
   order):

   (1) Section that displays the request and the result, starting with
   the field "query".

   (2) Section that displays information about the OID, starting with
   the field "object".

   (3) Section that displays information about the Registration
   Authority, starting with the field "ra".

   The service may define additional sections between or after these
   sections, but not at the beginning at the response.


3.3  Section that displays the query and the result

   This section must always be present and must start with the field
   "query". It must be the first section in the response.

   Possible fields:

   - "query" contains the request of the user (beginning with "oid:").
   No canonization or sanitation should be applied at this step.
   Authentication tokens must be omitted.

   - "result" may only be "Found", "Not found" or "Not found; superior
   object found". These result types are defined below.

   - "distance" is only present if the result is "Not found; superior
   object found". A distance of "1" means that the direct parent was
   found. A distance of "2" means that the grand-parent was found, etc.

INTERNET DRAFT               OID-over-WHOIS                 <Issue Date>


3.3.1  "RESULT: Found"

   The system can verify that the requested OID exists. It has either
   full information about the OID, or knows another service (e.g.
   another WHOIS service) where information can be retrieved from.

3.3.2  "RESULT: Not found; superior object found"

   The system cannot verify that the requested OID exists, or it denies
   that the OID exists (because it is confidential). However, the system
   knows a superior OID does exist. The response will show information
   about this superior OID instead.

2.3.3  "RESULT: Not found"

   The system cannot verify that the requested OID exists, or it denies
   that the OID exists (because it is confidential). Additionally, the
   system does not have information about any superior OID.


3.4  Section that displays information about the OID

   This section is mandatory if the result is not "Not found", and must
   start with the field "object".

   Possible fields:

   - "object" which shows the OID in dot-notation, beginning with
   "oid:".

   - "status" which usually has the value "Found", but it can also have
   different values like "Confidential" (in case the server doesn't deny
   the existence of the OID).

   - "whois-service" should be present if the service does not have full
   information about the OID (e.g. if the requested OID is inside a
   branch that was delegated to a different RA operating an own WHOIS
   service). If the response was "Found" (i.e. the service has full
   information about the OID), the information "whois-service" is only
   informational; its existence is most likely a hint that subsequent
   OIDs will be found at this WHOIS server. If the result is "Not found;
   superior object found", the client must query the referred WHOIS
   server in order to receive accurate information about the OID.

   - "url" (optional, multiple values allowed) contains a website that
   contains more information about the OID.

   - "identifier" (optional, multiple values allowed) contains the ASN.1

   alphanumeric value as defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC
   8824-1, clause 32 [X680].

   - "unicode-label" (optional, multiple values allowed) contains an
   Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) as defined in
   Recommendation ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1, clause 34 [X680].

   - "name" contains the name of the OID.

   - "description" (optional) contains a short description of the OID.

   - "information" (optional) contains additional information.

   - "created" (optional) contains the date the OID was allocated by the
   superior RA.

   - "registered" (optional) contains the date the OID was registered in
   the local database.

   - "updated" (optional) contains the date the OID was last updated.

   - "parent" (optional) contains the OID of the nearest known object,
   beginning with "oid:".

   - "subordinate" (optional, multiple values allowed) contains a list
   of subordinate OIDs, beginning with "oid:".

   - Additional fields can be defined by the service.


3.6  Section that displays information about the RA

   This section must not be present when result is "Not found",
   otherwise it is optional. If it is present, it must start with the
   field "ra".

   Fields:

   - "ra" contains a general name of the RA like a person name, a group
   name, or a company name.

   - "ra-status" shows the status of the RA. It can be "Found", "Not
   found" (if the service does only know the name of the RA and nothing
   else), or "Confidential".

   - "ra-name" (optional) contains the name of a person or group
   responsible for the allocation of OIDs.

   - "ra-organization" (optional) contains the name of the organization,
   in case "ra-name" is the name of a person or workgroup.

   - "ra-address" (optional) contains the postal address of the
   Registration Authority.

   - "ra-phone" (optional) contains the phone number of the Registration
   Authority, including the international country code.

   - "ra-fax" (optional) contains the fax number of the Registration
   Authority, including the international country code.

   - "ra-email" (optional) contains the email address of the
   Registration Authority.

   - "ra-created" (optional) contains the date the RA was
   created/registered in the database.

   - "ra-updated" (optional) contains the date the RA information was
   last modified.

   - Additional fields can be defined by the service, but must begin
   with "ra-".



3.7  Referral

   By using the field "whois-service", the service can instruct the
   client to query another service that might have more information
   about the requested object.

   If Registration Authorities maintain up-to-date references to WHOIS
   service references of their OID delegations, it is possible to
   automatically retrieve information about any OID.


   Example:

   OID 2.999 is owned by Registration Authority "A", operating a WHOIS
   service at "a.example.com".

   The OID 2.999.1000 has been allocated to Registration Authority "B"
   who is operating a WHOIS service at "b.example.com".

   The client asks a.example.com for information about 2.999.1000.1 and
   should receive following reply:

INTERNET DRAFT               OID-over-WHOIS                 <Issue Date>


       query:          oid:2.999.1000.1
       result:         Not found; superior object found

       object:         oid:2.999.1000
       status:         Found
       name:           Company "B"
       whois-service:  b.example.com

       ra:             "B"
       ra-status:      Not Found

   The client now knows that "a.example.com" only knows 2.999.1000, and
   that there is a reference to another WHOIS service located at
   "b.example.com". So, the client could then accordingly query
   "b.example.com", asking for information about 2.999.1000.1.

       query:          oid:2.999.1000.1
       result:         Found

       object:         oid:2.999.1000.1
       status:         Found
       name:           Example OID 1

       ra:             "B"
       ra-status:      Not Found

3.8  Date/Time references

   Date/Time references should have the format "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss +/-
   zzzz", e.g. "2019-03-15 18:32:00 +0200".

   If parts of the date/time reference are uncertain, they may be
   removed until the date/time reference has the highest correctness.

   Examples of valid date/time references:

   2019-03-15 18:32:00 +0200
   2019-03-15 18:32:00
   2019-03-15 18:32 +0200

   This document describes the usage of retrieving information about
   OIDs using the WHOIS protocol. In addition to the namespace "oid",
   the methods described in this RFC can also be applied to other
   namespaces like "ipv4", "ipv6", "uuid", "doi" etc.

   In the following example, the client wants to retrieve information
   about the IPv6 address "2001:1af8:4700:a07e:1::1336". The WHOIS
   service didn't find this particular IPv6 address in its database,
   however, it did find the address range "2001:1af8:4700:a07e:1::/112",
   with the distance of 16 (bits):

       query:        ipv6:2001:1af8:4700:a07e:1::1336
       result:       Not found; superior object found
       distance:     16

       object:       ipv6:2001:1af8:4700:a07e:1::/112
       status:       Found
       name:         ...
       description:  ...
       created:      ...
       updated:      ...

       ra:           ...
       ra-status:    Not found

   Another usage example is the retrieval of information about UUIDs
   (i.e. GUIDs used by Microsoft COM interfaces). The UUID namespace has
   no hierarchical structure, so the WHOIS service can only reply
   "Found" or "Not Found".

       query:        uuid:2a00375e-224c-49de-b8d1-440df7ef3ddc
       result:       Found

       object:       uuid:2a00375e-224c-49de-b8d1-440df7ef3ddc
       status:       Found
       name:         LocalizedResourcesDir
       description:  GUID used as "Custom Place" in file dialogs.
       created:      ...
       updated:      ...

       ra:           Microsoft Corp.
       ra-status:    Not found

6  Security Considerations

   The knowledge of existence or information about some OIDs could be
   considered confidential. In this case, the service can either deny
   the existence of the requested OID (by setting the result to "Not
   found") or redact information in the object output section.

   Registration Authorities might demand that their personal data is
   kept confidential, or at least be partially redacted to increase
   privacy or as a measurement against spam.

   The service can decide if confidential material is omitted or shown,
   based on authentication mechanisms like white-listing client IP
   addresses or by using authentication tokens supplied by the client
   during the request.

   The usage of authentication tokens is not recommended if the traffic
   between client and server is transmitted through an untrusted
   network, because the WHOIS protocol is not encrypted.

   Furthermore, authentication tokens must have an sufficient length to
   avoid brute force attacks, or the service must limit the number of
   requests.


7  IANA Considerations

   IANA is running a WHOIS service at whois.iana.org. This WHOIS service
   could be extended by allowing requests starting with "oid:" and could
   serve the following contents:

   (1) The service could output information about OIDs owned or
   delegated by IANA, for example it could output information about
   Private Enterprise Numbers (PEN) located at 1.3.6.1.4.1. Owners of
   Private Enterprise Numbers could store the addresses of their own
   WHOIS servers in the IANA database, so that these addresses can be
   included in the WHOIS output of IANA.

   (2) The service can furthermore maintain records for the OID roots
   "oid:" (refers to IANA itself), "oid:0" (refers to ITU-T), "oid:1"
   (refers to ISO) and "oid:2" (refers to either an ISO or an ITU-T
   server). This could alternatively be accomplished by a WHOIS service
   operated by ISO or ITU-T.
