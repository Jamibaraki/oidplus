<p>The registration of your OIDplus system has various advantages:</p><!-- please keep in sync with GDPR document -->

<ul>
	<li>The public key of your system will be published, so that users can check the integrity of your data (e.g. signed OID-over-WHOIS requests).</li>
	<li>Since the 31-bit System ID can have hash conflicts, ViaThinkSoft will make sure that the System ID is only used by your system (it will force other OIDplus systems with the same system ID to change their IDs).</li>
	<li>ViaThinkSoft can acknowledge the system name, admin email and OID root arcs. Therefore, your system can be found using referral WHOIS.</li>
	<li>You can optionally enable the automatic publishing of your public OID information to the repository oid-info.com.</li>
	<li>Your OIDplus version will be reported to ViaThinkSoft. If a severe bug or security vulnerability is affecting your system, ViaThinkSoft can warn you via email.</li>
	<li>The directory service will automatically create a X.509 security certificate for you (NOT a SSL certificate!) which can be used for various verifications.</li>
</ul>
