Dear sir or madam,

This is an automatic message from the OIDplus database system located at {{SYSTEM_URL}}.

You have been invited by {{PARTY}} to begin operating your own Registration Authority with objects delegated to you.

Currently, you have been marked as the Registration Authority of following objects:

{{OID_LIST}}

If you want to manage your Registration Authority and all subordinate objects, you can register to the system using this link: {{ACTIVATE_URL}}

If you don't want to register, you can still begin operating your Registration Authority, but you cannot display your allocated subordinate on the platform, which is not recommended.

If you think you have received this email message in error, please contact the server administrator at {{ADMIN_EMAIL}}
