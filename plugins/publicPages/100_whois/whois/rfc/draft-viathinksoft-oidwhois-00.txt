INTERNET DRAFT                 OID-WHOIS                    <Issue Date>


1  Introduction

   An Object Identifier (OID) is an extensively used identification
   mechanism jointly developed by ITU-T and ISO/IEC for naming any type
   of object with a globally unambiguous name. OIDs provide a persistent
   identification of objects based on a hierarchical structure of
   Registration Authorities (RA), where each parent has an Object
   Identifier and allocates Object Identifiers to child nodes. More
   information about OIDs can be found in Recommendation ITU-T X.660
   (2011) | ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012 [X660].

   There are a few methods of retrieving information about an Object
   Identifier, like:

   (A) Searching through web repositories like www.oid-info.com or
   www.alvestrand.no/objectid/ . This has the disadvantage that the
   information is usually not machine-readable without functionalities
   like an API.

   (B) Retrieving information using the Object Identifier Resolution
   System (ORS) defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.672 (2010) | ISO/IEC
   29168-1:2011 [X672]. This has the disadvantage that the Registration
   Authorities needs to include specific DNS Resource Records to their
   domain, and additionally, all superior RAs must implement the ORS.

   This document describes an additional method of retrieving
   information about OIDs, which is both human-readable and machine-
   readable.

   Three of many possible use-cases are:

   (1) Many web-browsers and Operating Systems are able to handle ITU-T
   X.509 certificates and usually contain a viewer application that
   shows the contents of a certificate. Attributes which are unknown by
   the application are either only displayed by their OID, or hidden to
   avoid confusion to the user. With OID-WHOIS, the application could
   query the name of these unknown OIDs or even retrieve instructions on
   how the data described by this OID can be parsed and displayed.

   (2) Systems that handle SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
   might need information about additional MIB files or their OIDs. OID-
   WHOIS could aid the applications gathering the required information.

   (3) In directory services like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol), applications could query the name of attributes which are
   described by an OID the application does not know.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, "RA" is an abbreviation for "Registration
   Authority" and "OID" is an abbreviation for "Object Identifier".

2  Request

   OID-WHOIS uses the WHOIS protocol specified in RFC 3912 [RFC3912].

   During the request, the client sends a query beginning with "oid:",
   followed by an OID in dot-notation, as defined in RFC 2252 [RFC2252],
   but with following differences:

   (a) Numbers MUST NOT have leading zeroes.

   (b) The OID MAY contain a leading dot at the beginning.

   (c) To query the root of the OID tree, the OID MUST be either missing
   or consisting only of a single dot.

   Examples of valid queries:

       oid:
       oid:.
       oid:2.999
       oid:.2.999

   All OIDs MUST be interpreted as absolute OIDs. Relative OIDs (e.g.
   relative to the OID of the Registration Authority operating the WHOIS
   service) are not allowed.

   The request MUST be treated case-sensitive.

2.1  Authentication tokens

   Some organizations might not want to present their OID information
   (or part of it) to the public, e.g. for reasons like privacy or
   confidentiality. Therefore, at the end of the query, the client can
   append case-sensitive, non-empty alphanumeric authentication tokens
   to control the display of confidential information returned by the
   WHOIS service.

   Each authentication token MUST be prepended by a dollar sign ("$").

   Examples of valid queries:

       oid:2.999$firstToken
       oid:2.999$firstToken$secondToken

   Please note that authentication tokens are only a weak protection.
   For more information, see section 7 ("Security Considerations").

2.2  BNF notation

   For the purposes of defining the query string, the following BNF
   definitions will be used. They are based on the BNF styles of RFC 822
   [RFC822].

   digit   = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"

   nonzero-digit = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"

   uppercase-char  = "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" /
                     "I" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" / "O" / "P" /
                     "Q" / "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" /
                     "Y" / "Z"

   lowercase-char  = "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" /
                     "i" / "j" / "k" / "l" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p" /
                     "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" / "v" / "w" / "x" /
                     "y" / "z"

   char-or-digit   = uppercase-char / lowercase-char / digit

   unsigned-number = "0" / nonzero-digit *( digit )

   oid             = unsigned-number *( "." unsigned-number )

   optional-oid    = 0*1( "." ) 0*1( oid )

   authtoken       = char-or-digit *( char-or-digit )

   namespace       = "oid"

   query           = namespace ":" optional-oid *( "$" authtoken )

3  Response

3.1  Format and encoding

   The response MUST be UTF-8 encoded (as defined in RFC 3629
   [RFC3629]), without Byte-Order-Mark (BOM).

   Each line SHOULD be limited to 80 characters, including field name,
   double colon, value and whitespaces.

   The response contains multiple lines with field names and values,
   which MUST be separated by a double colon (":"). Whitespace
   characters after the double colon are allowed.

   Field names MUST be treated case-insensitive, while values MUST be
   treated case-sensitive.

   If a value needs to be split into multiple lines, e.g. if the line
   would exceed the length limit, the field name including double colon
   MUST be repeated at the beginning of the new line.

   If attributes have multiple values (e.g. multiple Unicode labels,
   alternative email-addresses etc.), a new line with the same field
   name MUST be added.

   Comment lines MUST start with a percent sign ("%") at the beginning
   of a line, without prepending whitespaces. Comment lines MUST NOT be
   evaluated by machines (except for signature validation, as mentioned
   in section 3.3 "Digital Signature").

3.2  Structure

   A response consists of sections, which are defined in the following
   clauses. Sections SHOULD be separated by at least one empty line
   and/or comment line.

   This document defines the following sections (which SHALL stay in
   this order):

   (1) Query-Section which contains the request and the result. This
   section MUST start with the field "query".

   (2) Object-Section which contains information about the OID. This
   section MUST start with the field "object".

   (3) RA-Section which contains information about the current
   Registration Authority. This section MUST start with the field "ra".

INTERNET DRAFT                 OID-WHOIS                    <Issue Date>


   The WHOIS service MAY define additional sections after any of these
   sections, but the Query-Section MUST be the first section in the
   response.

3.2.1  Query-Section (information about query and result)

   This section MUST always be present and MUST start with the field
   "query". It MUST be the first section in the response.

   Possible fields:

   - "query" MUST be present and contain the request of the client
   (beginning with the namespace, i.e. "oid:"). Canonization or
   sanitation (like removing a leading dot) SHOULD NOT be applied at
   this step. Authentication tokens SHOULD be omitted, though.

   - "result" MUST be present and MUST be one of the following values:

       "Found" means that the system can verify that the requested OID
       exists. It has either full information about the OID, or knows
       another WHOIS service where information can be retrieved from.

       "Not found; superior object found" means that the system cannot
       verify that the requested OID exists, or it denies that the OID
       exists (e.g. because it is confidential). However, the system
       knows a superior OID does exist. The response will show
       information about this superior OID instead.

       "Not found" means that the system cannot verify that the
       requested OID exists, or it denies that the OID exists (e.g.
       because it is confidential). Additionally, the system does not
       have information about any superior OID, or its existence is also
       denied.

   - "distance" SHOULD be present if it is applicable in the namespace
   (it is always applicable for OIDs) and if the result is "Not found;
   superior object found". A distance of 1 means that the direct parent
   was found. A distance of 2 means that the grand-parent was found,
   etc.

3.2.2  Object-Section (information about the OID)

   This section MUST be present if the result is "Found" or "Not found;
   superior object found". It MUST start with the field "object".

   Possible fields:

   - "object" contains the OID in dot-notation, prepended by the
   namespace ("oid:"). This field MUST be present.

   - "status" SHOULD usually have the value "Information available", but
   it can also have different values like "Confidential" (in case the
   server doesn't deny the existence of the OID). This field MUST be
   present.

   - "whois-service" SHOULD be present if the WHOIS service doesn't have
   full information about the OID (e.g. if the requested OID is inside a
   branch that was delegated to a different RA operating their own WHOIS
   service) but knows a WHOIS server which can handle the request. If
   the result was "Found" (i.e. the WHOIS service has full information
   about the OID), the information "whois-service" is only
   informational; its existence is most likely a hint that subsequent
   OIDs will be found at that WHOIS server. If the result is "Not found;
   superior object found", the client SHOULD query the referred WHOIS
   server in order to receive more information about the OID.

   - "url" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a URL to a
   website that contains more information about the OID.

   - "identifier" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains the ASN.1
   alphanumeric value ("NameForm") as defined in Recommendation ITU-T
   X.680 (2015) | ISO/IEC 8824-1:2015, clause 32 [X680].

   - "standardized-id" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains an
   identifier that has a standardized NameForm, i.e. in an ASN.1
   notation, it can be written without its associated number.

   - "unicode-label" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a
   Unicode label that can be used in an OID Internationalized Resource
   Identifier (OID-IRI), as defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.680 (2015)
   | ISO/IEC 8824-1:2015, clause 34 [X680].

   - "long-arc" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a Unicode
   label that can be used as first identifier in an ORI-IRI, shortening
   it.

   - "attribute" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains attributes
   for that OID. Possible attributes: "leaf" (this means that no child
   OIDs can be allocated under this OID), "frozen" (this means that no
   more child OIDs can be created under this OID, e.g. because the RA
   has stopped operating, but the existing child OIDs stay valid), "no-
   identifiers" (this means that the RA is not allocating identifiers),
   or "no-unicode-labels" (this means that the RA is not allocating
   Unicode labels).

   - "name" contains the name of the OID. This field SHOULD be present.

   - "description" (OPTIONAL) contains a short description of the OID.

   - "information" (OPTIONAL) contains additional information.

   - "created" (OPTIONAL) contains the date the OID was allocated by the
   superior RA.

   - "registered" (OPTIONAL) contains the date the OID was registered in
   the local database.

   - "updated" (OPTIONAL) contains the date the OID was last updated.

   - "parent" (OPTIONAL) contains the OID of the nearest known parent
   OID, beginning with "oid:".

   - "subordinate" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a list
   of subordinate OIDs, beginning with "oid:".

   Additional fields can be defined by the WHOIS service. The field
   names SHALL only consist of the lower-case letters "a..z", hyphens (-
   ) and numbers, and SHOULD be written in English language.

3.2.3  RA-Section (information about the current RA)

   This section MUST NOT be present if result is "Not found", otherwise
   it MAY be present. If it is present, it MUST start with the field
   "ra".

   Possible fields:

   - "ra" contains a general name of the RA, like the name of a person,
   the name of a workgroup, or a company name. This field MUST be
   present.

   - "ra-status" shows the status of the RA. It SHOULD usually be
   "Information available", "Information unavailable" (if the WHOIS
   service does only know the name of the RA and nothing else), or
   "Confidential". Other values are permitted. This field MUST be
   present.

   - "ra-name" (OPTIONAL) contains the name of a person or group
   responsible for the allocation of OIDs.

   - "ra-organization" (OPTIONAL) contains the name of the organization,
   in case "ra-name" is the name of a person or workgroup.

   - "ra-address" (OPTIONAL) contains the postal address of the
   Registration Authority, including the name of the country.

   - "ra-phone" (OPTIONAL) contains the landline phone number of the
   Registration Authority, including the international country code.

   - "ra-mobile" (OPTIONAL) contains the mobile phone number of the
   Registration Authority, including the international country code.

   - "ra-fax" (OPTIONAL) contains the fax number of the Registration
   Authority, including the international country code.

   - "ra-email" (OPTIONAL) contains the email address of the
   Registration Authority.

   - "ra-created" (OPTIONAL) contains the date the RA was
   created/registered in the database.

   - "ra-updated" (OPTIONAL) contains the date the RA information was
   last modified.

   Additional field names can be defined by the WHOIS service, but they
   MUST begin with "ra-", SHALL only consist of the lower-case letters
   "a..z", hyphens (-) and numbers, and SHOULD be written in English.

3.3  Digital Signature

   If integrity/authenticity is required, the whole response can be
   signed, e.g. by using S/MIME, RSA or PGP. This document does not
   describe a mechanism for detecting which signature method was used.
   The creation and verification of the signature is therefore
   implementation specific and no interoperability regarding signature
   creation and validation is given at this time.

   Depending on the signature method being used, various things need to
   be appended and/or prepended to the response. These additions MUST be
   prepended by a percent sign ("%") to avoid that an application
   confuses these additions (e.g. a PGP header) with part of the actual
   WHOIS response. The comment lines which belong to the signature SHALL
   be removed before the signature is validated, so that the leading
   percent sign ("%") in front of the signature block will not be
   evaluated as part of the message content.

3.4  Date/Time references

   Date/Time references should have the format "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss +/-
   zzzz", e.g. "2019-03-15 18:32:00 +0200".

   If parts of the date/time reference are uncertain, they may be
   removed until the date/time reference has the highest correctness.

   Examples of valid date/time references:

   2019-03-15 18:32:00 +0200
   2019-03-15 18:32:00
   2019-03-15 18:32 +0200
   2019-03-15 18:32
   2019-03-15

4  Referral

   By using the field "whois-service", the WHOIS service can instruct
   the client to query another WHOIS service that might have more
   information about the requested object.

   If Registration Authorities maintain up-to-date references to WHOIS
   service references of their OID delegations, it is possible to
   automatically retrieve information about any OID.

   Example: OID 2.999 is owned by Registration Authority "A", operating
   a WHOIS service at "a.example.com".

   The OID 2.999.1000 has been allocated to Registration Authority "B"
   who is operating a WHOIS service at "b.example.com".

   The client asks a.example.com for information about OID 2.999.1000.1
   and should receive the following reply:

       query:          oid:2.999.1000.1
       result:         Not found; superior object found
       distance:       1

       object:         oid:2.999.1000
       status:         Information available
       name:           Company "B"
       whois-service:  b.example.com

       ra:             "B"
       ra-status:      Information unavailable

   The client is now aware that "a.example.com" only knows OID
   2.999.1000, and that there is a reference to another WHOIS service
   located at "b.example.com". So, the client could then accordingly
   query "b.example.com", asking for information about OID 2.999.1000.1.

       query:          oid:2.999.1000.1
       result:         Found

       object:         oid:2.999.1000.1
       status:         Information available
       name:           Example OID 1

       ra:             "B"
       ra-status:      Information unavailable

6  Alternative namespaces

   This document describes the usage of retrieving information about
   OIDs using the WHOIS protocol. In addition to the namespace "oid",
   the methods described in this document can also be applied to other
   namespaces like "uuid", "isbn", "gtin" etc.

   Following things need to be considered if alternative namespaces are
   applied:

   (1) The request MUST be UTF-8 encoded (as defined in RFC 3629
   [RFC3629]), without Byte-Order-Mark (BOM).

   (2) The namespace SHALL only consist of the lower case letters 'a' -
   'z'.

   (3) The identifier that is requested MUST NOT contain a dollar sign
   ($), because it is defined as separator for authentication tokens.


6.1  Example: UUID Namespace

   In the following example, the client wants to retrieve information
   about the IPv6 address "2001:1af8:4700:a07e:1::1336". The WHOIS
   service didn't find this particular IPv6 address in its database,
   however, it did find the address range "2001:1af8:4700:a07e:1::/112",
   with the distance of 16 (bits):

   The following example shows the retrieval of information about UUIDs
   (e.g. GUIDs used by Microsoft COM interfaces). The UUID namespace has
   no hierarchical structure, so the WHOIS service can only respond with
   the result "Found" or "Not found".

       query:        uuid:2a00375e-224c-49de-b8d1-440df7ef3ddc
       result:       Found

       object:       uuid:2a00375e-224c-49de-b8d1-440df7ef3ddc
       status:       Information available
       name:         LocalizedResourcesDir
       description:  GUID used as "Custom Place" in file dialogs.
       created:      ...
       updated:      ...

7  Security Considerations

   (1) The knowledge of existence or information about some OIDs could
   be considered confidential. In this case, the WHOIS service can
   either deny the existence of the requested OID (by setting the result
   to "Not found") or redact information in the object output section.

   (2) Registration Authorities might demand that their personal data is
   kept confidential, or at least be partially redacted to increase
   privacy or as a measurement against spam.

   (3) The WHOIS service can decide if confidential material is omitted
   or shown, based on authentication mechanisms like white-listing
   client IP addresses or by using authentication tokens supplied by the
   client during the request.

   (4) The usage of authentication tokens is not recommended if the
   traffic between client and server is transmitted through an untrusted
   network, because the WHOIS protocol is not encrypted. Furthermore,
   authentication tokens must have a sufficient length to avoid brute
   force attacks, or the WHOIS service must limit the number of
   requests.

   (5) The WHOIS protocol itself has no mechanism for verifying the
   integrity of data received. Due to this fact, information should not
   be trusted if it is transmitted through an untrusted network.

   (6) If integrity/authenticity is required, the WHOIS output can be
   signed, as described in section 3.3 "Digital Signature". However,
   this document does not describe a mechanism for detecting which
   signature method was used. Therefore, no interoperability of
   signature creation/validation is given at this time.

8  Internationalization Considerations

   The original WHOIS protocol as defined in RFC 3912 [RFC3912] does not
   define any character set and there is no mechanism for indicating
   which character set is in use.

   To enhance interoperability, the request and response MUST be UTF-8
   encoded (as defined in RFC 3629 [RFC3629]), without Byte-Order-Mark
   (BOM).

   The WHOIS service can define additional field names, but they SHOULD
   be written in English language so that there is consistency with the
   predefined field names in this specification.

9  IANA Considerations

   IANA is running a WHOIS service at whois.iana.org. This WHOIS service
   could be extended by allowing requests starting with "oid:" to output
   information about OIDs owned or delegated by IANA, for example it
   could output information about Private Enterprise Numbers (PEN)
   located at OID 1.3.6.1.4.1. Owners of Private Enterprise Numbers
   could store the addresses of their own WHOIS servers in the IANA
   database, so that these addresses can be included in the WHOIS output
   of IANA. This would enable the referral functionality described in
   section 4 ("Referral").
